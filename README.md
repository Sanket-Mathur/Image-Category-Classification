This project classifies the image into multiple categories.  
The top 5 classes predicted by the model are displayed along with their probability scores.

The project uses a pre-trained model to perform the classification.  
The model is accessible at [tensorflowhub](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/efficientnet_v2_imagenet1k_s/classification/2).
